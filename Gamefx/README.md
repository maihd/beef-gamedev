# Basic framework for gamedev with Beef

## Architecture
- Each source file/module should contains itself and only, so other users can easily copy to their project.
- Module is design to solve its problems only and should do well.
- Module is design around the ideas of single header library in C.
- The final purpose is help user to select what modules are needed, and easily import to their projects.
